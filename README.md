# Principal Component Analysis of PAH fluxes in reflection nebula NGC 2023
We performed the principal component analysis (PCA) of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.0 and 11.2 micron in the reflection nebula NGC 2023 to study the previously reported variations in the PAH emission. Fluxes of the emission features are taken from Peeters et al. 2017. 

The 'pca' folder contains the data and the python code to perform the PCA analysis.

To analyse the data, following figures are made using the code:

Biplots

Eigen Spectra of Principal Components

Characteristic Spectra of Principal Components

Correlation plots of Principal Components with various PAH fluxes

Spatial maps of Principal Components, radiation field strengths, and PAH fluxes

# Following packages are required to run the code:
numpy

math

scipy

matplotlib

sklearn


# Type the following to run the code:
python pca.py

Note: Uncomment lines at the end of the code, depending on the figure you wish to create.
