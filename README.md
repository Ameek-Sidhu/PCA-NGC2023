# Principal Component Analysis of PAH fluxes in reflection nebula NGC 2023
We performed the principal component analysis (PCA) of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.0 and 11.2 micron in the reflection nebula NGC 2023 to study the previously reported variations in the PAH emission. Fluxes of the emission features are taken from Peeters et al. 2017. 

The 'pca' folder contains the data and the python code to perform the PCA analysis.

# Following packages are required to run the code:

sklearn


# Type the following to run the code:
